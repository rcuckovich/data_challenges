First, thank you for the YvesBlue Data Engineer Take Home Exam.  Doing this exam was an excellent opportunity to learn more about the position.

##1. Query Optimization
File List and Explanation:

Cuckovich_1_CAC_create_insert_data_challenges.sql -- text file with SQL which creates db tables and inserts the initial data.  
    I was unable to pull the data from the .dmp file that was provided.  
    As a work-around, I opened the file took the information inside and made my own SQL queries to create the tables and insert the data.
    I used a query browser in pgadmin 4.

Cuckovich_1_CAC_sql_V4.sql -- SQL file with my queries that I ran to modify the data_challenges database as requested.  
    There are comments in the file addressing the question you asked as well.

Cuckovich_1_CAC_output_dump_file.sql -- Dump file (type plain text) with the database after running my SQL queries in the previous file.  
    This dump file is not with an extension of .dmp as the instructions requested but instead is a plain text dump file I created with pgadmin 4.  
    I hope that is ok.  Let me know if you have any issues.


##2. Carbon Analytic Calculation
File List and Explanation:
Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V8.ipynb -- Jupyter Notebook file with my Python code with the function named strawman_org_emissions to calculate the (strawman) Adjusted CO2 Total emissions for a company.
    Note that the first line of the file should be commented out unless you want to update the .py file used for pytests.

test_Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V2.ipynb -- Jupyter Notebook file with my Python code for the test cases.  Has a cell to run the pytests.
    Also, creates test_Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V2.py file in the first line which is needed for running the pytests.  
    Note that the first line of the file should be commented out unless you want to update the .py file used for pytests.

Cuckovich_2_CAC.py -- File created inside Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V8.ipynb in order for pytest work.

test_Cuckovich_2_CAC.py -- File created inside test_Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V2.ipynb in order for pytest work.

cac_data.json -- I renamed the data.json file that you provided to me with the initial dataframe since I like descriptive names while working.

cac_clean_data.json, cac_non_numeric_data, cac_zero_data are all modified versions of cac_data.json that are used for different test cases

Cuckovich_2_CAC_output.json -- The dataframe with the new column that has (strawman) Adjusted CO2 Total emissions.  The dataframe is generated by the strawman_org_emissions function.


How to Call the Function:
Use Jupyter Notebooks to open Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V8.ipynb
The method signature is strawman_org_emissions(df_cac, curr_mu_purch, curr_mu_max_purch, curr_phi_prod).  
You can change the global variables.  If you don't include them, they will default to the values I was given.
Run the cell with the code-->  output = strawman_org_emissions(df_cac, curr_mu_purch, curr_mu_max_purch, curr_phi_prod) to call the function

How to Run the Tests:
Use Jupyter Notebooks to open test_Cuckovich_2_CAC_solution_V2.ipynb
Run the cell that has the following code !pytest

##3. Data QA
File List and Explanation:
Cuckovich_3_QA_solution.xlsx -- I filled out the Excel as instructed.  I also added a sheet called Cuckovich Notes that has some information on my QA process.
